## Overview

Unicorn Hunter analyzes GitHub repositories using codebase metrics (stars, forks, commits, contributors, etc.) to calculate:
- **Unicorn Score** (0-100) - A speculative score indicating potential for $1B+ valuation
- **Valuation Estimates** - Conservative, realistic, and optimistic valuation ranges
- **Component Scores** - Breakdown by community momentum, development velocity, technology quality, market potential, and network effects
- **Natural Language Interpretation** - AI-generated explanations of scores and factors

## Features

- 🎯 **Flexible Input** - Accepts both GitHub URLs (`https://github.com/owner/repo`) and owner/repo format (`owner/repo`)
- 📊 **Comprehensive Analysis** - Detailed metrics and component score breakdowns
- 💬 **Natural Language Insights** - AI-powered interpretation of results
- 🎨 **Beautiful UI** - Modern design with dark/light theme support
- ⚡ **Fast Analysis** - Real-time repository analysis via MCP backend

## Important Disclaimer

**This analysis is based solely on codebase metrics and does NOT consider:**
- Daily Active Users (DAU)
- Revenue or business metrics
- User engagement data
- Market conditions

**Valuations are capped at $1 billion (unicorn status)** and are purely speculative estimates based on GitHub activity patterns. These should not be considered financial advice.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 16
- **UI**: React 19, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI
- **Backend**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or pnpm

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

### Development

# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Build

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build
# or
pnpm build
```

## Usage

1. Enter a GitHub repository URL or owner/repo format
   - Examples:
     - `https://github.com/facebook/react`
     - `facebook/react`
     - `vercel/next.js`
2. Click "Hunt Unicorn" to analyze
3. View comprehensive results including:
   - Unicorn score and status
   - Valuation estimates (conservative, realistic, optimistic)
   - Component score breakdown
   - Repository metrics
   - Natural language interpretation

## Backend Integration

This app connects to an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for repository analysis:

- **Endpoint**: `https://valuation-mcp-server-554655392699.us-central1.run.app`
- **Tools Used**:
  - `analyze_github_repository` - Fetches repository data and metrics
  - `unicorn_hunter` - Calculates unicorn scores and valuations
